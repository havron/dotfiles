# dotfiles
custom settings and defaults for various applications I use. mostly just
[`.vimrc`](/.vimrc) for now!
The files in [`/bin/`](/bin/) are intended to be placed in `/usr/local/bin`.

Want to add excitement to your `/bin/bash` life? run `sudo visudo` and replace
`Defaults env_reset` with `Defaults env_reset,insults`. Enjoy the next time you
try to run anything as root and get your password wrong.
